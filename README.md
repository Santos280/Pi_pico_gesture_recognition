# Gesture recognition on Pi Pico

Embedded machine learning has now become easy with the help of online platforms like Edge Impulse and allows creators to devise their own application with just a little or no knowledge on Machine learning.

In this project I have created a basic gesture recognition device using an MPU6050 accelerometer sensor and a pi pico. The model is trained to recognize left-right ,up-down and idle motion and can be enhanced further by adding more gestures to it. The gesture recognized can either be read from the serial monitor or from an led which blinks at different rates based on the up-down and left-right motion recognized.

The whole application is developed on the pico's C/C++ sdk on VScode and the edge impulse platform for training the model.
I have made this project only for learning purpose and it does not serve any practical purpose.

## Bill of materials
1. Raspberry pi pico.
2. MPU6050 sensor.
3. Breadboard.
4. Jumper wires.
